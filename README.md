Constant.py contains the player and team names. Application.py holds the code to a basketball stats tool in this second Team Treehouse Python Techdegree!
This project held many challenges other than cleaning the data from constants. It took time and a lot of trial and error to divide the teams evenly and fixing my little syntax errors seemed to take up an inordinate amount of time. But it worked eventually!
